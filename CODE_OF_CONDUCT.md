# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- **Being respectful**: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- **Being inclusive**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- **Being collaborative**: Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- **Being supportive**: Focusing on what is best for the overall community
- **Being accountable**: Showing empathy towards other community members and accepting responsibility for our mistakes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **Harassment**: The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- **Trolling**: Insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- **Public or private harassment**: Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- **Intimidation**: Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in-person)
- **Disruption**: Sustained disruption of talks, presentations, or other events
- **Other conduct**: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Contributing to the project's codebase, documentation, or discussions

## Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
**[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

1. **Your contact information** (so we can follow up if needed)
2. **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved
3. **Description of the incident** - what happened and when
4. **Context** - any relevant background information
5. **Screenshots or links** - if applicable and if you have them
6. **Any other information** you believe is relevant to the incident

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will not disclose the identity
of reporters without their explicit consent, except as required by law.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Conflict Resolution

We encourage all community members to resolve conflicts constructively. Before
reporting an incident:

1. **Try to resolve it directly**: If you feel comfortable, try addressing the
   issue directly with the person involved
2. **Seek mediation**: Ask a trusted community member to help mediate
3. **Report formally**: If the above steps don't work or aren't appropriate,
   file a formal report

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. Sending an email to **[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]** with "Appeal" in the subject
   line
2. Including a detailed explanation of why you believe the decision was
   incorrect
3. Providing any relevant evidence or context

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original
decision, and a final determination will be made within 14 days.
